# cpp_Greedy


---

*(implemented class Graph, MinHeap, Dijkstra's Algorithm and Prim's minimum Spanning Tree from scratch)*

---
### A Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the average shortest path in a graph. 
#### (_commented out:_)
The graph can be generated using a pseudo-random number generator to produce edges and their costs. 
The shortest path algorithm will be Dijkstraâ€™s

---
### Prim's minimum spanning tree

---
#### Graph can be passed as file
exapmle: _g1.txt_

---
#### Implemented in C++

---
[_Somewhat detailed skeleton of the project_](TODO.md)
