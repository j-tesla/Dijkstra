# cpp_Greedy

---
### A Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the average shortest path in a graph. 
#### (_commented out:_)
The graph can be generated using a pseudo-random number generator to produce edges and their costs. 
The shortest path algorithm will be Dijkstraâ€™s

---
### Prim's minimum spanning tree

---
#### Graph can ne passed as file
exapmle: _g1.txt_

---
#### Implemented in C++
